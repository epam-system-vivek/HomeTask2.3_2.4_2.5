<!--Function composition is a mathematical operation that mainly presents itself in lambda calculus 
    and computability. It is explained well here, but this is my explanation, in simple mathematical notation:

f3 = compose( f1 f2 )
   Is equivalent to...
f3(a) = f1( f2( a ) )
Your task is to create a compose function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions or lambdas. 
 Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!

compose(f , g)(x)
=> f( g( x ) )
